# Github Demo

This is a simple graphrocket testing app. This still in very early development.

## Setup

### Install gems

    bundle install --binstubs

### Set variables

  You will need to set the `NEOGRAPHY_URI` to connect to Neo4j on production. It will try to connect to a local instance of neo4j on development.


### Start the app

  You can start the app by typing:

    ruby server.rb

  Now you can point your browser to `http://localhost:4567`
